<font color = #b6b6b6 > Size: </font> 18 in. x 24 in <br>
<font color = #b6b6b6 > Date: </font> Fall 2012 <br>
<font color = #b6b6b6 > Description: </font> This piece is a still life that was drawn from a dark fabric being thrown over a piece of bamboo. 
The texture of the fabric is manifested as the material has a soft yet dense quality. The fabric also appears heavy which contrasts 
the width of the small bamboo stick that supports it. The values lean more towards darker shades rather lighter tints, highlighting the darker 
color of the original fabric. <br>

<font color = #b6b6b6 > Date: </font> Fall 2012 <br>
<font color = #b6b6b6 > Description: </font> This piece is a still life that was drawn from a dress on a mannequin. The body of the dress has three 
distinct textures: a plaited material around the shoulders and bust line, a smooth and sturdy midsection, and folds in the bottom section that are 
formed by pleats. The thicker lines in the top section fade through the midsection as the smoother texture becomes more apparent. Each fold of 
the bottom section is formed by a pleat or combination of pleats and is manifested in the various values. <br>

<font color = #b6b6b6 > Description: </font>This piece is a still life that was drawn from an American flag being thrown over a box and placing various 
sized glass bottles on top. The various values of the flag reflect the lighting of the room as spotlights were casted on selected areas of the still life. 
When viewed through one of the glass bottles, the stripes of the flag are contorted, becoming wavy and changing direction.  <br>

<a id="cloak" class="anchor" href="#cloak" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Cloaked Fabric </h3>

<font color = #b6b6b6 > Date: </font> Fall 2012 <br>
<font color = #b6b6b6 > Description: </font>This piece is a still life that was drawn from a dark fabric being thrown over a post structure. The top of 
the post is represented by the tip of the fabric and how it flows down and out from that single point. The values manifest the smooth texture of the 
material and the various folds and curves that the underlying structure has caused it to form. There is also a hemline that lies an inch above the bottom 
of the material that can be followed throughout various areas of the piece. <br>

<font color = #b6b6b6 > Date: </font> Fall 2012 <br>
<font color = #b6b6b6 > Description: </font>This piece is a still life that was drawn from an arrangement of white objects placed on top of a white sheet 
on a table. The darker shades appear where certain objects cast shadows on other objects as well as the negative space in the background. The lighter tints 
appear where the spotlights highlighted certain parts of the objects. <br>

<h3>
<a id="two" class="anchor" href="#two" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Two Folds </h3>

<font color = #b6b6b6 > Description: </font>This piece is a still life that was also drawn from the posted structure of the “Cloaked Fabric”, however, it is 
drawn from a different viewpoint. In this piece, the values are the darkest inside the various folds and in the slope between the two posts. The texture is 
smooth, similar to the previous viewpoint of this structure.  <br>

<font color = #b6b6b6 > Description: </font>This piece is a still life that was drawn from an arrangement of various objects with various colors. There is a 
broad range of values of this piece, from the darkest shades on the black mannequin on the left to the lightest tints on the highlights of the skull 
and white mannequin. Each object also has a different texture. The box on the far right appears grainy, while the top edges of the white mannequin are jagged. <br>

<font color = #b6b6b6 > Size: </font> 22 in. x 30 in <br>
<font color = #b6b6b6 > Date: </font> Fall 2012 <br>
<font color = #b6b6b6 > Description: </font>This piece is a still life that was drawn from an arrangement of large objects, all with varied textures, patterns, 
materials, and values. Rather than draw the entirety of the still life, we were required to focus on a smaller section. The large patterned fabric on the right 
side is the back of an old dress. There is also a faded leather suitcase, glassware, reflective aluminum containers and a paper flower. The reflection of the 
flower pots depicts the classroom and the various students sitting at their individual drawing boards with the lights in the ceiling above us. The leather 
suitcase is cracking and is also partially reflective on one side. <br>

<font color = #b6b6b6 > Media:  </font> Blue Painter's Tape <br>
<font color = #b6b6b6 > Size: </font> approx. 9 ft. x 7 ft.  <br>
<font color = #b6b6b6 > Date: </font> Summer 2014 <br>
<font color = #b6b6b6 > Description: </font> This piece was made solely with blue painter’s tape, scissors, and an X-ACTO knife. The object was to create a 
design in the stairway using a unique media (i.e. tape). My goal in this piece was to play off the location of a stairwell and 
make it seem like whoever was walking the stairs could go multiple directions. This was accomplished by extending the physical 
staircase visually and having it extend upwards into a door. There are also several staircases that stem from the main stairs or 
go beneath it. In addition to bringing the two-dimensional to life, I also experimented with three-dimensional on the right side 
of the piece. Instead of limiting the tape to the wall itself, I allowed it to connect the two walls by forming a truly three-dimensional 
staircase that pops out from the wall and ends as a two-dimensional staircase.
